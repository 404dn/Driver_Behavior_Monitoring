There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<h2 align="center"> The Software </h2>
For the server side, I had the option of using python as I already Knew the language and had built similar tcp servers with it, but because there might be alot of messages that are going to be sent to the server in a short duration, I wanted a fast languge to avoid data loss, so i choose type script, and saw this as a good opportunity to learn the langauge.

For the front end, Previously i had used SWFIT which is IOS native langauge, but i wanted to learn something new, so i settled for Reacte Native, the advanatge of using Reacte native is the that its widely supported and there is alot of libraries that make it very easy to develop and application quickly, as well as it uses HTML for the UI elements and CSS for styling the elements which makes it infinitely easier, more over Reacte native when complied gives two files, one is for IOS and the other is for ANDRIOD so it saves alot of time if developing for both platforms.

<h2 align="center"> The Hardware </h2>
<p>The system relies on TelTonika Device, fmc 130, This device is specifically made for this task, its built for monitoring all kinds of data and input from the vehicle, the device allows the user to preset some thersholds and parameters that determines when dose the device alert and under what conditions, as well as it sends location and speed based on a preset interval, the deivce can be connected to the nemours systems that are in the car and can display all sorts of data, the device comes with its own software for ease of programmability and deployment.<p>
